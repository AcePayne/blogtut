# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions for this repo

Summary
- Minimal Astro 5 static site scaffold. Primary entry points: `src/pages/` for routes and `public/` for static assets.

Quick architecture
- Static site generated by Astro. No server-side API code in repository.
- Routes: files under `src/pages/` map to site routes (e.g., `src/pages/index.astro` → `/`).
- Components: place UI pieces in `src/components/` and import them into `.astro` pages.
- Build output: `npm run build` produces a `./dist/` folder for deployment.
- Config: `astro.config.mjs` contains project-level integrations and adapters.

Developer workflows (exact commands)
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Local dev server (hot-reload): `npm run dev` (defaults to localhost:4321)
- Build for production: `npm run build` (output in `./dist/`)
- Preview the production build locally: `npm run preview`
- Run Astro CLI tasks: `npm run astro -- --help`

Project-specific patterns and guidance for AI assistants
- New pages: create an `.astro` file in `src/pages/`. Example: `src/pages/about.astro` becomes `/about`.
- Components: use `src/components/` (create if missing). Typical import in a page:

  ```astro
  ---
  import Header from '../components/Header.astro'
  ---
  <Header />
  ```

- No server endpoints or backend services are present; avoid suggesting server-side architecture changes unless the user adds them.
- Keep changes minimal and focused: edits should typically touch `src/pages/`, `src/components/`, `public/`, `package.json`, or `astro.config.mjs`.

Integration and external deps
- Dependencies and scripts live in `package.json`. Prefer using existing npm scripts rather than adding new shell wrappers.
- `astro.config.mjs` is the authority for adapters (e.g., static adapter). Inspect it before changing build/deploy behavior.

Code style & conventions
- Follow the Astro convention of using `.astro` for page templates and component composition.
- Static assets (images, fonts) belong in `public/` and should be referenced with absolute paths (e.g., `/img/logo.png`).

What to avoid
- Do not add server-only libraries or Node-specific runtime code unless the project explicitly adds an adapter and server entry.
- Do not change the repository layout unnecessarily; this is a minimal template and users often expect the canonical structure.

If you modify files
- Run `npm run dev` locally to verify pages render and there are no build errors.
- If you change `astro.config.mjs` or `package.json`, run `npm run build` then `npm run preview` to validate the production output.

Where to look for examples in this repo
- `src/pages/index.astro` — primary example page
- `astro.config.mjs` — project config and integrations
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies

Questions for the maintainer
- Do you want AI suggestions to add components under `src/components/` automatically? Yes
- Any preferred formatting or linting rules to enforce (Prettier/ESLint)? No specific rules; follow standard Astro conventions.
